Hey! Coming to [my talk](https://2014.event.springone2gx.com/schedule/sessions/the_revolution_will_not_be_centralized.html) at SpringOne 2GX on Wednesday? Do this **before** you arrive:

    git clone https://github.com/cbeams/s2gx.git
    cd s2gx
    ./gradlew run

The app doesn't do anything at the moment. I'll push the actual code onstage. Then everyone participating will do this:

    git pull
    ./gradlew run

The app that you run will be a puzzle, and you'll be in a race with everyone else's CPUs to solve it. The first few to solve it and send me the solution via email will get a reward. I'll explain both the puzzle and the reward during the talk. 

**The reason to clone and run the app now is to download its dependencies ahead of time.** If you're doing that during the race, you'll definitely lose :)

The only requirements are git and JDK 8. But you're a SpringOne attendee, so you already have both installed... _right_?

See you tomorrow!
